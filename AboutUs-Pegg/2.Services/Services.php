    <h1>Loft Director</h1>
    <h2>Jon Pegg</h2>
    <img src="2.Services/Image/SlideHome.png" alt="">

    <p>Jon grew up on the Yealm and has been sailing since he could pretty much walk. He trained in yacht and boatbuilding at college, this made him realise that there is no better place to be than on the water. Since then he has managed race boats, skippered charter AC boats, captained a 72′ ketch, sold yachts, distributed marine deck hardware and rigging products for a top UK rigger.</p>
    <p>Jon has been on the race scene for many years, in the past helming Farr 45’s, campaigning a J133 winning RORC overall, being tactician for one of the winning boats in the British team for the 2012 Commodores Cup and more recently winning Dartmouth Regatta 2016 on a Kerr 40.</p>
    <p>Nowadays you will find Jon racing many types of boats from Ker 40’s, Ballard’s, Seascape 18’s and of course his beloved Devon Yawl.</p>
    <p>With this rounded knowledge of anything boat-like he is a perfect fit to continue the exciting changes that can already be seen at Ullman Sails.</p>
