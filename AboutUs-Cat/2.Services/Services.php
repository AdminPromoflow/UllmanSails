    <h1>Managing Director</h1>
    <h2>Catrina Southworth</h2>
      <img src="2.Services/Image/catrina-2.jpg" alt="">
    <p>I had spent 28 years working with start-ups and growing companies, before Ullman Sails. I am passionate about ensuring that the client receives the product or service they expect.   I am equally driven to make sure the team behind the product works to the same goal, and in a fun environment.</p>
    <p>In 2014, there was an opportunity to rekindle Ullman Sails in the UK.  Clients require sails that will last.  Their sails are their power for adventure.  Sailing enables friends to laugh and enjoy time together on the water.  </p>
    <p>Clients do not want to be forever racing back for tweaks.  They want to enjoy their cruising with sails that have longevity.  With care the sails will perform for many hours.</p>
    <p>It was a joy to meet up with Jon Pegg, and latterly Rob Larke.  Both share the passion of ensuring that the clientâ€™s time on the water is simply the best.</p>
    <p>Jon brings with him the knowledge of rigging and how that affects the shape of the sails.  Jon also has some impressive racing credentials.  Jon can be found coaching on the water as he shares his knowledge to get boats moving faster.</p>
    <p>Rob loves being on the winning team.  He knows how to get the most out of everyone, and everything on the boat.  Behind the scenes he works with our team of designers to make the sails fast for every boat.</p>
    <p>If you are racing or cruising we are here to help you to have fun on the water.</p>
